I am using this project to learn about Tailwind CSS, but mostly to learn about docker, containers, WSL2, automatic deploys, GitHub Actions, GitHub packages, deployment to DigitalOcean, etc.

## Docker commands

`docker-compose up --build -d`
`docker rm -f <container_id>`
`docker rmi -f <image_id>`
`docker exec -it <command>`

# ShopTailwind [![.github/workflows/pipeline-cd.yml](https://github.com/Gummiees/shop-tailwind/actions/workflows/pipeline-cd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Gummiees/shop-tailwind/actions/workflows/pipeline-cd.yml) [![.github/workflows/pipeline-ci.yml](https://github.com/Gummiees/shop-tailwind/actions/workflows/pipeline-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Gummiees/shop-tailwind/actions/workflows/pipeline-ci.yml)

I am using this project to learn about Tailwind CSS, but mostly to learn about docker, containers, WSL2, CI/CD, GitHub Actions, GitHub packages, deployment to DigitalOcean, etc.

You can check the website deployed by GitHub Actions inside a Docker container on a Droplet server from DigitalOcean obtain from the GitHub Packages registry (which was also pushed with the GitHub Action) on http://gummiees.com/

## Why this repo is special to me

- First time having success working with Docker images and containers ðŸŽ‰
- Developed entirely on Docker inside of WSL2 Ubuntu
- First time using GitHub Packages
- First time doing CI/CD "manually" with GitHub Actions (meaning that I do not just click on a button like on Heroku automatic deploys)
- GitHub Actions workflows have been adapted and they are not a basic copy&paste. I understand what it does ðŸŽ‰
- First time deploying something via commands on a remote server which uses Ubuntu (first time using SSH without PuTTY)
- Understanding of images, containers, Dockerfiles, compose files, etc.
- First time working with NGINX

## Docker commands

- `docker-compose up --build -d`
- `docker rm -f <container_id>`
- `docker rmi -f <image_id>`
- `docker exec -it <command>`

## SSH commands
- `sudo ssh root@ip -i ./.ssh/droplet-sshkey`

## Roadmap

- Create static personal website
- Install and use tailwind CSS to make a beautiful, responsive shop interface
- Develop it on a Docker container inside WSL2
- Create post on Medium showing how to do it
- Add unit testing and e2e testing
- Create different workflow to run tests and CI when PR opens
- Set the current workflow to run when PR merges
- Develop the same with VueJs
